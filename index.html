    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have recently graduted from University of Houston -Downtown with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
I have worked in the past as IT support for Houston Independent School District where I helped teachers and staff with technology.
I got introduced to computer science when I was in high school and took a course called " AP Computer Science". 
From there my curiosity took over and fell in love with programming. Some things I like to do in my free time is play video games and soccer. 
The game I spend the most time playing is League of legends. I also like to program random ideas that I get and also like to do some coding challenges on Leetcode. 
My first language was Java then I got introduced to C++ in college got proficient with that. My current go-to language is Python at the moment.
